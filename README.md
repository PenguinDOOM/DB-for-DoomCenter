# DB-for-DoomCenter
## At last, the database mod came to doomcenter.

Use the database to store almost all but a few items.  
They are retained even after you disconnect from the game or restart the server.  
  
Must create an account at http://auth.zandronum.com/  
  
Always check for new versions https://allfearthesentinel.net/zandronum/wads.php?user=2904 or https://github.com/PenguinDOOM/DB-for-DoomCenter/releases/latest  
  
Good dooming!
